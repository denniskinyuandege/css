                    <div id="text">IT services that our IT company provide.
                </b><br></b>
                IT companies form the backbone of the modern business or organization. Technology has infiltrated the
                workplace so much that we cannot do without it. IT service providers offer the technical support
                necessary for the smooth running of businesses, both in management and normal operations. Here are ten
                services that IT companies can provide.
                <ol>
                    <li> Programming services</li>
                    IT companies create new programs tailored to the organization’s needs. It could be a program to
                    manage the workforce or software to monitor and track stock. The IT company will create, test, and
                    install the new programs in the computers of the client.
                    <li> Networking services</li>
                    When computers within a business or organization need to be connected to form a local network, it’s
                    IT companies that take care of this. The IT firm may still be contracted to monitor the network to
                    secure it and to ensure it’s up and running without any technical issues.
                    <li>Security</li>
                    With the ever-growing threat of hacking and other cyber crimes, companies end on IT firms to provide
                    security services. The IT companies have specialists in the field of IT security who can create
                    secure systems and install software to monitor and disable potential threats.
                    <li>Solving IT problems</li>
                    Whether software or hardware, IT specialists are the ones depended upon to troubleshoot and resolve
                    issues with computers in an organization. The IT companies offer the services on a contractual
                    basis, or they may be called in only when a problem arises. We recently fixed the full IT system for
                    Petra Equipment.
                    <li>Website design and maintenance</li>
                    IT companies are involved with writing code for new websites and carrying out tests to ascertain if
                    it runs smoothly and bug-free. The IT firm may even run the website on behalf of businesses and
                    organizations.
                    <li>Training employees</li>
                    IT companies train employees on how to use new software that has just been introduced in the
                    organization. The new software may have come from the IT company itself, or from other sources.
                    Check out our case studies on Petra Group.
                    <li>Maintaining IT systems</li>
                    Businesses employ the services of IT companies to oversee the technology systems of the business.
                    This may happen if there exists no IT department within the business itself. The IT company is
                    tasked with ensuring the smooth running of the systems and carrying out diagnostic and repair
                    activities.
                    <li>Collecting and storing data</li>
                    IT companies collect and store data on behalf of clients. The data is mostly stored on the cloud,
                    and the IT company is concerned with its retrieval when needed and in ensuring it’s secure from
                    access by any third party. Since September 2017, we are in charge of providing advice on how to
                    collect and store data from Petra Kitchenware website.
                    <li>Setting up of new systems</li>
                    When new IT systems are brought into the organization, it’s IT companies that are called in to set
                    them up. The IT specialists may even give short training sessions on the use of the systems to
                    employees.
                    <li>Maintaining of a help desk</li>
                    IT companies offer the services of a help desk where customers can call in with IT ems and receive
                    advice on how to tackle them. It forms a part the IT firms’ mission to ensure customers are well
                    served.
                    IT services are important for the smooth running of any organization. With everything hinged on
                    technology, the services of IT companies help to boost performance. New projects in an organization
                    get off on the right footing and get technological support all through. We additionally offer
                    marketing services such as SEO Gold Coast.
